			<h4 class="headline mb-2">Two Very Distinct Visions for the Future</h4>
			<h4 class="date mb-3">Oct 6, 2024</h4>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Last Tuesday's debate showcased two very distinct visions for the future.</p>
				<p>Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people.</p>
				<p>In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.</p>
				<p>In what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance made clear he'd put Trump ahead of the country.</p>
				<p>On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. In the campaign's live focus group of undecided battleground voters:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The highest ratings from the first half of the night were for Walz when he talked about putting women in charge of their health care.</li>
					<li>Walz outperformed Vance in the immigration section: The highest rating for Governor Walz of the night was when he reminded viewers of Trump's failed promise at the border, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/01/vp-vice-presidential-debate-fact-check-2024/75383643007/" target="_blank">only building about 2% of his wall.</a></li>
					<li>His passionate answer citing Matthew 25 about how his faith guides his empathy and commitment to treat people the right way was one of his highest dial moments of the night.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>On the other side of the stage, Vance spent the whole debate trying to defend Trump's failed record and disastrous plans.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vance had no answer for why those closest to Trump have warned how dangerous he is.</li>
					<li>He had no defense for why Trump single-handedly killed the toughest, fairest border security deal in decades to help himself politically - so he resorted to arguing with the moderators instead.</li>
					<li>He had no real answer to Walz calling out Trump's tax cuts for the very wealthy - and why Trump is now proposing a 20% across the board sales tax that would increase inflation, raise costs, and potentially lead to a recession.</li>
					<li>He failed to defend Trump's "concepts of a plan" to raise health care costs and rip coverage away from millions of Americans.</li>
					<li>And Walz held Trump responsible for the horrific experiences of women across the country - like Amber Nicole Thurman, who died under a Trump Abortion Ban in Georgia - and underscored the threat Trump's Project 2025 agenda poses to women's health care, including plans to ban abortion nationwide with or without Congress.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The choice facing the American people in November was on full display last night: between charting a new way forward or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.</p>
